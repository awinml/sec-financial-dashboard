Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented in Exhibit 21.1 . Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns, the pace of energy transition and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations, select feedstocks, and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. Operating Environment Refer to pages 32 through 40 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. Chevrons Strategic Direction Chevrons strategy is to leverage its strengths to deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. The companys primary objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. In the upstream, the companys strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities. In the downstream, the companys strategy is to be the leading downstream and chemicals company that delivers on customer needs. Chevron aims to lower the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the companys capabilities, assets and customer relationships. Information about the company is available on the companys website at www.chevron.com . Information contained on the companys website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the companys website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SECs website at www.sec.gov . ________________________________________________________ * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we, us and ""its"" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or non-equity method investments. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. Human Capital Management Chevron invests in its employees and culture, with the objective of developing the full potential of its workforce to deliver energy solutions and drive human progress. The Chevron Way explains the companys beliefs, vision, purpose and values. It guides how the companys employees work and establishes a common understanding of culture and aspirations. Chevron hires, develops, and strives to retain a diverse workforce of high-performing talent, and fosters a culture that values diversity, inclusion and employee engagement. Chevron leadership is accountable for the companys investment in people and the companys culture. This includes reviews of metrics addressing critical function hiring, leadership development, retention, diversity and inclusion, and employee engagement. The following table summarizes the number of Chevron employees by gender, where data is available, and by region as of December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021 Female Male Gender data not available 1 Total Employees Number of Employees Percentage Number of Employees Percentage Number of Employees Percentage Number of Employees Percentage Non-Service Station Employees U.S. 5,090 26 % 14,512 74 % 25  % 19,627 46 % Other Americas 925 27 % 2,484 72 % 37 1 % 3,446 8 % Africa 612 17 % 2,991 83 % 3  % 3,606 8 % Asia 2,493 35 % 4,621 65 % 31  % 7,145 17 % Australia 533 25 % 1,634 75 % 3  % 2,170 5 % Europe 381 25 % 1,121 75 % 2  % 1,504 4 % Total Non-Service Station Employees 10,034 27 % 27,363 73 % 101  % 37,498 88 % Service Station Employees 2,170 43 % 1,732 34 % 1,195 23 % 5,097 12 % Total Employees 12,204  29  % 29,095  68  % 1,296  3  % 42,595  100  % 1 Includes employees where gender data was not collected or employee chose not to disclose gender. Hiring, Development and Retention The companys approach to attracting, developing and retaining a diverse workforce of high-performing talent is anchored in a long-term employment model that fosters an environment of personal growth and engagement. Chevrons philosophy is to offer compelling career opportunities and a competitive total compensation and benefits package linked to individual and enterprise performance. Chevron recruits new employees in part through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In addition, the company recruits experienced hires to provide specialized skills. Chevrons learning and development programs are designed to help employees achieve their full potential by building technical, operating and leadership capabilities at all levels to produce energy safely, reliably and efficiently. Chevrons leadership regularly reviews metrics on employee training and development programs, which are continually evolving to meet the needs of our evolving business. For example, the company delivers learning experiences digitally to empower its employees, in any location, to develop, maintain and enhance critical skills. In addition, to ensure business continuity, leadership regularly reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for key positions. The Board of Directors provides oversight of CEO and executive succession planning. Management routinely reviews the retention of its professional population, which includes executives, all levels of management, and the majority of its regular employee population. The annual voluntary attrition for this population was 4.5 percent, which is in line with rates over a five-year comparison period. The voluntary attrition rate generally excludes employee departures under enterprise-wide restructuring programs. Chevron believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of the companys commitment to employee development, its long-term employment model, competitive pay and benefits, and its culture. Diversity and Inclusion Chevron believes innovative solutions to the most complex challenges emerge when diverse people, ideas, and experiences come together in an inclusive environment. Chevron reinforces the values of diversity and inclusion through recruitment and talent development, equitable selection processes, community partnerships and supplier diversity. Examples of initiatives to further advance diversity and inclusion include the companys MARC (Men Advocating Real Change) program launched in 2017 in partnership with the non-profit organization Catalyst to facilitate discussions on gender equity in the workplace, and selection processes that reinforce the importance of diverse selection teams and candidate slates. In addition, Chevron has twelve employee networks (voluntary groups of employees that come together based on shared identity or interests) and a Chairmans Inclusion Council, which provides the employee network presidents with a direct line of communication to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and the executive leadership team to collaborate and discuss how employee networks can reinforce Chevrons values of diversity and inclusion. Employee Engagement Employee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the companys values, purpose and strategies. Chevron regularly conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the companys culture; recent surveys indicate high employee engagement. In 2021, the company increased survey frequency to better understand employee sentiment throughout the year, including focused efforts to gain insights into employee well-being. Chevron prioritizes the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Chevrons safety culture empowers every member of its workforce to exercise stop-work authority without repercussion to address any potential unsafe work conditions. Chevron developed new safeguards and operating standards and updated existing protocols to adjust for the ever-changing conditions of the pandemic, including a return to the workplace strategy, with paced, condition-based stages. The company also announced a hybrid work model based on employee feedback and learnings from the pandemic, which will allow certain employees the flexibility to combine in-office and remote work. Additionally, the company offers long-standing employee support programs such as Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees with options to address and resolve workplace issues; a company hotline, where employees can report concerns to the Corporate Compliance department; and an Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that can help employees resolve a broad range of personal, family and work-related concerns. Description of Business and Properties The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects * in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings, assets, and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2021, and assets as of the end of 2021 and 2020  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 14 Operating Segments and Geographic Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Note 15 Investments and Advances and Note 18 Property, Plant and Equipment .

Delivery Commitments The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas and crude oil sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver approximately 16 million barrels of crude oil and 759 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2022 through 2024. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are primarily based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2022 through 2024 from operations in Australia and Israel. The Australia sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that generally reference the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The sales contracts for Israel contain formulas that generally reflect an initial base price subject to price indexation, Brent-linked or other, over the life of the contract. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries. Development Activities Refer to Table I for details associated with the companys development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2021, 2020 and 2019. The following table summarizes the companys net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the companys development wells drilling at December 31, 2021.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas Chevron has exploration and production activities in many of the worlds major hydrocarbon basins. Chevrons 2021 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 38, are presented below. The comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under Production in Exhibit 99.1 . The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. United States Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, California, Colorado, and the Gulf of Mexico. Acreage for the United States can be found in the table on page 8. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be found in the table on page 7. Chevron is one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin with a production outlook of more than one million barrels of net oil equivalent production per day by 2025. The companys advantaged portfolio of development areas in west Texas and southeast New Mexico is comprised of stacked formations enabling production from multiple geologic zones from single surface locations. Chevron has implemented a Permian factory development strategy utilizing multi-well pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are subsequently completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. Top tier drilling and completions performance has enabled year-over-year capital expenditure efficiency improvement and cycle time reduction generating higher returns throughout Chevrons Permian portfolio. Chevrons Permian operations have also demonstrated continual progress on its lower carbon and water goals, consistently ranking among the best Permian operators for methane emissions intensity, routine flaring, and water handling (utilizing 99 percent brackish or recycled sources). In 2021, Chevrons net daily unconventional production in the Permian Basin averaged 284,000 barrels of crude oil, 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 148,000 barrels of NGLs. Conventional production averaged 10,000 barrels of crude oil, 39 million cubic feet of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of NGLs per day. Chevron holds mature assets in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas that produced 29,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in 2021. In 2021, Chevron was one of the largest crude oil producers in California with a net daily oil equivalent production of 96,000 barrels. Chevron completed front-end engineering and design (FEED) in second quarter 2021 on a carbon capture project for emissions reduction from the gas turbines in one of our California co-generation facilities. This project leverages two innovative technologiescarbon dioxide concentration and carbon captureand has the potential to scale across our full fleet of turbines. A final investment decision for this project is expected in third quarter 2022, with anticipated start-up in 2024. Chevron is also progressing the installation of a 20MWh battery at the solar power plant in the Lost Hills field with start-up expected in third quarter 2022. In Colorado, development in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin is primarily focused on Chevrons Mustang and Wells Ranch areas where the companys comprehensive drilling plans allow for efficient resource development. Chevrons net daily production in the DJ Basin averaged 56,000 barrels of crude oil, 302 million cubic feet of natural gas and 36,000 barrels of NGLs during 2021. Chevron also has operations in Colorados Piceance Basin as well as acreage positions in Wyoming and Utah. During 2021, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 180,000 barrels of crude oil, 102 million cubic feet of natural gas and 12,000 barrels of NGLs. Chevron is engaged in various operated and nonoperated exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron also holds nonoperated interests in several shelf fields. The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Additional development opportunities for the Jack and St. Malo fields progressed in 2021. The St. Malo Stage 4 waterflood project includes two new production wells, three injector wells, and topsides water injection equipment at the St. Malo Field. Two oil production wells were placed online, and first injection is expected in 2023. Additional Jack development in 2021 consisted of a single well tieback and related subsea infrastructure installation. The Stage 4 multiphase subsea pump project replaced the single-phase subsea pumps in both the Jack and St. Malo fields.

The company continues development of renewable base oil through our patented technology and majority ownership in Novvi and has made progress integrating this renewable base oil into Chevrons lubricant product lines. Chevron developed Havoline Pro-RS, with lifecycle emissions that are 35 percent lower than those of conventional motor oil of equal viscosity. In November 2021, the company made this renewable based lubricant available to professional installers in the United States and Canada, and it is expected to be available to U.S. consumers in early 2022. Transportation Pipelines Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and product pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and indirect interests in other U.S. and international pipelines. Chevron acquired all of the outstanding common units of Noble Midstream Partners LP not already owned by Chevron or any of its affiliates in May 2021. Refer to pages 13 and 14 in the Upstream section for information on the West African Gas Pipeline and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Shipping The companys marine fleet includes both U.S. and foreign flagged vessels. The operated fleet consists of conventional crude tankers, product carriers and LNG carriers. These vessels transport crude oil, LNG, refined products and feedstock in support of the companys global upstream and downstream businesses. In December 2021, Chevron joined the Sea Cargo Charter, a benchmark initiative for responsible shipping activities, transparent greenhouse gas reporting, and improved decision making in line with the United Nations decarbonization targets. Other Businesses Chevron Technical Center The companys technical center provides expertise to drive the application of technology, initiatives to transform Chevrons digital future, and innovative breakthrough technologies to support the future of energy. The organization conducts research, develops and qualifies technology, and provides technical services and competency development. The disciplines cover earth sciences, reservoir and production engineering, drilling and completions, facilities engineering, manufacturing, process technology, catalysis, technical computing and health, environment and safety. Chevrons information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, cybersecurity and network technology to provide a digital infrastructure to enable Chevrons global operations and business processes. Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV) leverages innovative companies and technologies to strengthen Chevrons core operations and identifies new opportunities with the potential to enhance the way Chevron produces and delivers affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy. CTV has more than two decades of venture investing, with eight funds that have supported more than 100 startups and worked with more than 200 co-investors. In addition to the companys own managed funds, Chevron also is a limited partner in the following funds: the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) Climate Investments fund, which targets the decarbonization of oil and gas, industry and commercial transportation; the Emerald Ventures fund, which targets energy, water, industrial IT and advanced materials; and the HX Venture fund, which targets Houston, Texas high-growth start-up companies. Chevron continued its participation as a member of OGCI, a global collaboration focused on the industrys efforts to take actions to accelerate and participate in a lower carbon future. In 2021, the Climate Investments fund made additional investments and deployed or piloted portfolio technologies with member companies, helping enable methane and CO 2 emissions reductions, as well as advancing carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies. Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes; therefore, the ultimate technical or commercial successes of these investments are not certain. Refer to Note 27 Other Financial Information for quantification of the companys research and development expenses. Chevron New Energies The new energies organization was formed in 2021 and is designed to advance the companys strategy by bringing together dedicated resources focused on growing new lower carbon businesses that have the potential to scale. Its initial focus will include commercialization opportunities in hydrogen, CCUS, and carbon offsets. These businesses are expected to support the companys efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and are also expected to become high-growth opportunities with the potential to generate accretive returns. Environmental Protection The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. To complement the companys capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project, which has the objective to further develop the industrys capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. The company is committed to lowering the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations, in addition to complying with the greenhouse gas-related laws and regulations to which it is subject.

Risk Factors As a global energy company, Chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS Impacts of the continuation or further resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse and potentially material adverse effect on Chevrons financial and operating results The economic, business, and oil and gas industry impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption to capital markets have been and continue to be far reaching. While the oil and gas industry witnessed a substantial recovery of commodity prices and demand for products during 2021, there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial and operating results in future periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results, and for what duration and magnitude, depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve, are difficult to predict and, in many instances, are beyond the company's control. Such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any further resurgences of the COVID-19 virus and its variants, and the impact on our workforce and operations; the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy and economic activity, including travel restrictions and prolonged low demand for our products; the ability of our affiliates, suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the actions of OPEC and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand and, correspondingly, commodity prices; the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the pandemic subsides; and Chevrons ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products. The companys suppliers continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and access to materials, supplies, and contract labor has been strained. This strain on the financial health of the companys suppliers could put pressure on the companys financial results and may negatively impact supply assurance and supplier performance. In-country conditions, including potential future waves of the COVID-19 virus and its variants in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates, could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity. In light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, management is currently unable to develop with any level of confidence estimates and assumptions that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period. In addition, the unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight. In addition, the continuation or further resurgences of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and profitability, including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control (including without limitation due to the COVID-19 pandemic), competing fuel prices, geopolitical risks, the pace of energy transition, and governmental regulations and policies regarding the development of oil and gas reserves. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the companys upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in new business lines such as the lower carbon businesses associated with our Chevron New Energies organization. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition depends. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, other forms of severe weather, wildfires, ambient temperature increases, sea level rise, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevrons risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. Cyberattacks targeting Chevrons process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevrons cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the companys information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the companys process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. Additionally, authorized third-party IT systems or software can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to Chevron's IT systems that can materially impact the companys business. Regardless of the precise method or form, cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident, series of events, or unforeseen liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ESG-RELATED RISK FACTORS Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action. For example, liability or delays could result from an accidental, unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 16 Litigation . Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing political, regulatory and economic environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with sanctions and other trade laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the companys operations and financial results in certain countries. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products, could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitability. Legislative or regulatory changes in tax laws may expose Chevron to additional tax liabilities Changes in tax laws and regulations around the world are regularly enacted due to political or economic factors beyond the companys control. Chevrons taxes in the jurisdictions where the company conducts business activities have been and may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or regulations. Furthermore, Chevrons tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities around the world. There is no assurance that taxing authorities or courts will agree with the positions that Chevron has reflected on the companys tax returns, in which case interest and penalties could be imposed that may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. For information concerning the companys tax liabilities, see Note 17 Taxes and Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments . Legislation, regulation, and other government actions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change could continue to increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevronshydrocarbon and other products, resulting in a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition Chevron has experienced and may be further challenged by increases in the impacts of international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other government actions relating to GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) and climate change. International agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of implementation. The company is currently subject to implemented programs in certain jurisdictions such as the U.S.Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and low carbon fuel standard obligations. Further, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries in which we operate may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. Globally, multiple jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms, such as a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program, or performance standards, or to indirectly advance reduction of GHG emissions through restrictive permitting, trade tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, increased GHG reporting and climate-related disclosure requirements, or tax advantages or other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy, fuel sources or lower-carbon technologies. GHG emissions that may be directly regulated through such efforts include, among others, those associated with the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction, and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and related products; and customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products. Indirectregulation of GHG emissions could include, among other things, bans or restrictions on technologies or products that use the companys hydrocarbon products. Many of these actions, as well as customers preferences and use of the companys products or substitute products, and actions taken by the companys competitors in response to legislation and regulations, are beyond the companys control. Similar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG emissions and climate change-related legislation, regulation, or other government actions may curtail profitability in the oil and gas sector, or render the extraction of the companys hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible. In particular, GHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and other governmentactions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing GHG emissions may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbon-based products; increase demand for lower carbon products and alternative energy sources; make the companys products more expensive; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the companys resources; impact or limit our business plans; and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues, margins and reputation. The ultimate effect of international agreements; national, regional, and state legislation and regulation; and government and private actions related to GHG emissions and climate change on the companys financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, theextent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and governmentactions on the companys financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes, including the actual laws and regulations enacted, the variables and tradeoffs thatinevitably occur in connection with such processes, and market conditions. Increasing attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business Increasing attention to ESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, increasing societal, investor and legislative pressure on companies to address ESG matters, and potential customer use of substitutes to Chevrons products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof, negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets, and damage to our reputation. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation, or threats thereof, against the company. For instance, we have received investigative requests and demands from the U.S. Congress for information relating to climate change, methane leak detection and repair, and other topics, and further requests and/or demands are possible. At this time, Chevron cannot predict the ultimate impact any Congressional or other investigations may have on the company. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, including climate change and climate-related risks. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Also, some stakeholders, including but not limited to sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds, have been divesting and promoting divestment of or screening out of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Unfavorable ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives, among other actions, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, evolving expectations on various ESG matters, including biodiversity, waste and water, may increase costs, require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment. Our aspirations, targets and disclosures related to ESG matters expose us to numerous risks, including risks to our reputation and stock price In October 2021, Chevron announced an aspiration to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions in Upstream by 2050. The company also has set nearer-term GHG emission-related targets for zero routine flaring, upstream carbon intensity, portfolio carbon intensity, and refining carbon intensity. These aspirations, targets or objectives reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately report on these goals and objectives present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material negative impact, including on our reputation and stock price. Our ability to achieve any aspiration, target or objective, including with respect to climate-related initiatives, our new lower carbon strategy outlined in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, pages 32 through 34, and any lower carbon new energy businesses, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (1) the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (6) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals; (7) customers preferences and use of the companys products or substitute products; and (8) actions taken by the companys competitors in response to legislation and regulations. The standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period. In addition, our processes and controls may not always align with evolving voluntary standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. Achievement of or efforts to achieve aspirations and targets such as the foregoing and future internal climate-related initiatives may increase costs, require purchase of carbon credits, or limit or impact the companys business plans and financial results, potentially resulting in the reduction to the economic end-of-life of certain assets, an impairment of the associated net book value, among other material adverse impacts. Our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill such aspirations and targets or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have a negative impact on investor sentiment, ratings outcomes for evaluating the companys approach to ESG matters, stock price, and cost of capital and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation, among other material adverse impacts. GENERAL RISK FACTORS Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions, the pace of energy transition, or changes in the companys outlook on commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

As previously disclosed, the refinery in Pasadena, Texas acquired by Chevron on May 1, 2019 (Pasadena Refining System, Inc. and PRSI Trading LLC) has multiple outstanding Notices of Violation (NOVs) that were issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality related to air emissions at the refinery. The Pasadena refinery is currently negotiating a resolution of the NOVs with the Texas Attorney General. Resolution of these alleged violations is expected to result in the payment of a civil penalty of $1.0 million or more. As previously disclosed, the California Department of Conservation, California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM) (previously known as the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources) promulgated revised rules pursuant to the Underground Injection Control program that took effect April 1, 2019. Subsequent to that date, CalGEM issued NOVs and two orders to Chevron related to seeps that occurred in the Cymric Oil Field in Kern County, California. An October 2, 2019 CalGEM order seeks a civil penalty of approximately $2.7 million. Chevron has filed an appeal of this order. Chevron is currently in discussions with CalGEM to explore a global settlement to resolve the order and all past and present seeps in the Cymric Field, which would increase the amount of penalty paid. As previously disclosed, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Environmental Protection Agency notified Noble Energy, Inc., Noble Midstream Partners LP and Noble Midstream Services, LLC of potential penalties for alleged Clean Water Act violations at two facilities in Weld County, Colorado relating to a 2014 flood event and requirements for a Spill Prevention and Countermeasures Plan and Facility Response Plan.

1,cvx-,20201231," Item 1. Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products and lubricants; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented in Exhibit 21.1 on page E-1. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. Operating Environment Refer to pages 31 through 38 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. Chevrons Strategic Direction Chevrons primary objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. In the upstream, the companys strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities. In the downstream, the companys strategy is to be the leading downstream and chemicals company that delivers on customer needs. In seeking to help advance a lower carbon future, Chevron is focused on lowering its carbon intensity cost efficiently, increasing renewables and offsets in support of its business, and investing in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions. Information about the company is available on the companys website at www.chevron.com . Information contained on the companys website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the companys website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SECs website at www.sec.gov . ________________________________________________________ * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we, us and ""its"" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or non-equity method investments. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. Human Capital Management Chevron is focused on investing in its employees and its culture. Chevron hires, develops, and strives to retain critical talent, and fosters a culture that values diversity and inclusion and employee engagement, all of which support the companys overall objective to deliver industry leading performance. Chevrons leadership reinforces and monitors the companys investment in people and the companys culture. This includes reviews of metrics addressing critical function hiring, leadership development, attrition, diversity and inclusion, and employee engagement. The following table summarizes Chevrons number of employees by gender, where data is available, and by region as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 Female Male Gender data not available 1 Total Employees Number of Employees Percentage Number of Employees Percentage Number of Employees Percentage Number of Employees Percentage U.S. 6,632 28 % 16,606 70 % 491 2 % 23,729 50 % Other Americas 894 26 % 2,484 73 % 33 1 % 3,411 7 % Africa 715 17 % 3,507 83 % 6  % 4,228 9 % Asia 2,982 29 % 7,334 71 % 80 1 % 10,396 22 % Australia 1,746 40 % 2,584 60 % 6  % 4,336 9 % Europe 410 25 % 1,226 75 % 0  % 1,636 3 % Total Employees 2 13,379 28  % 33,741 71  % 616 1  % 47,736 100  % 1 Includes employees where gender data was not collected or employee chose not to disclose gender. 2 Includes 5,108 service station employees; 2,312 and 1,672 new employees came from the 2020 Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings Pty. Ltd and Noble Energy, Inc. acquisitions, respectively. Hiring, Development and Retention The companys approach to attracting, developing and retaining its employees is anchored in a career-oriented employment model. Chevron recruits new employees through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In 2020, over 500 students participated in the companys first ever virtual internship program. In addition, the company recruits experienced hires to target critical skills. Development programs are designed to build leadership capabilities at all levels and ensure the companys workforce has the technical and operating capabilities to produce energy safely and reliably. Chevrons leadership regularly reviews metrics on employee training and development programs, which are continually evolving to better meet the needs of the business. For instance, Chevron recently launched learning initiatives focused on digital innovation, including new Digital Academy and Digital Scholars programs. In addition, to ensure business continuity, leadership regularly reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for leadership positions. The Board provides oversight of CEO and executive succession planning. Chevrons 2020 annual voluntary attrition was 4.1 percent, in line with its historical rates. The voluntary attrition rate generally excludes employee departures under enterprise-wide restructuring programs. Chevron believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of the companys commitment to employee development and career advancement. Diversity and Inclusion Chevron is committed to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace so that employees are enabled to contribute to their full potential. The company believes innovative solutions to its most complex challenges emerge when diverse people, ideas, and experiences come together in an inclusive environment. Chevron reinforces the value of diversity and inclusion through accountability, communication, training and personnel selection processes. Examples of initiatives to further advance diversity and inclusion include the companys Neurodiversity program through which the company employs neurodiverse individuals and leverages their talents, its Elevate program which focuses on learning opportunities to promote a deeper understanding of employees in underrepresented groups, and its Returnship initiative which provides support for women re-entering the workforce. In addition, Chevron has twelve employee networks (voluntary groups of employees that come together based on shared identity or interests) and more than fifteen diversity councils across its business units that help align diversity and inclusion efforts with business strategies. Employee Engagement Employee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the companys values, purpose and strategies. Chevron regularly conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the companys culture. Recent surveys have indicated a high degree of employee engagement. In 2020, the companys employee survey focused on the COVID-19 impact on employee well-being and the companys response to the pandemic. The survey results positively reinforced actions taken by Chevron, and helped inform further actions to address the impact on employees and their families through enhanced mental health and wellness support, financial assistance for unplanned childcare needs and remote learning resources, among other efforts. The company also has long-standing programs such as Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees with options to address and resolve workplace issues; a company hotline, where employees can report concerns to the Corporate Compliance department; and its Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that can help employees resolve a broad range of personal, family and work-related concerns or problems. Description of Business and Properties The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects * in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2020, and assets as of the end of 2020 and 2019  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 74. Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Note 13 beginning on page 77 and Note 16 on page 82. Refer to page 44 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys capital and exploratory expenditures. Upstream Reserves Refer to Table V beginning on page 103 for a tabulation of the companys proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs), synthetic oil and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2018 and at each year-end from 2018 through 2020. Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations. At December 31, 2020, 27 percent of the companys net proved oil-equivalent reserves were located in the United States, 18 percent were located in Australia and 20 percent were located in Kazakhstan. The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2018 through 2020 are shown in the following table: At December 31 2020 2019 2018 Liquids  Millions of barrels Consolidated Companies 4,475  4,771 4,975 Affiliated Companies 1,672  1,750 1,815 Total Liquids 6,147  6,521 6,790 Natural Gas  Billions of cubic feet Consolidated Companies 27,006  26,587 28,733 Affiliated Companies 2,916  2,870 2,843 Total Natural Gas 29,922  29,457 31,576 Oil-Equivalent  Millions of barrels 1 Consolidated Companies 8,976  9,202 9,764 Affiliated Companies 2,158  2,229 2,289 Total Oil-Equivalent 11,134  11,431 12,053 1 Oil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of crude oil . ________________________________________________________ * As used in this report, the term project may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities.

Delivery Commitments The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 1,136 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2021 through 2023. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are primarily based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2,800 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2021 through 2023 from operations in Australia and Israel. The Australia sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that generally reference the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The Israel sales contracts contain formulas that generally reflect an initial base price subject to price indexation, Brent-linked or other, over the life of the contract and have a contractual floor. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries. Development Activities Refer to Table I on page 99 for details associated with the companys development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2020, 2019 and 2018. The following table summarizes the companys net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the companys development wells drilling at December 31, 2020.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas Chevron has exploration and production activities in many of the worlds major hydrocarbon basins. Chevrons 2020 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 37, are presented below. The comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under Production in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-7. The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. United States Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, California, Colorado and the Gulf of Mexico. Acreage for the United States can be found in the table on page 7. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be found in the table on page 6. With the acquisition of Noble in October 2020, Chevron increased its position in the Permian Basin and acquired acreage in Colorado and Wyoming. The companys acreage in the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. The company is also applying data analytics and technology to drive improvements in identifying well targets, in drilling and completions and in production performance. In 2020, Chevrons net daily unconventional and conventional production in the Permian Basin averaged 294,000 barrels of crude oil, 980 million cubic feet of natural gas and 150,000 barrels of NGLs. In 2020, Chevron was one of the largest crude oil producers in California. Construction was completed in April 2020 on a new 29-megawatt solar farm to supply power to the Lost Hills Field. In October 2020, Chevron announced participation in a carbon capture trial in California with start-up expected in 2022. In Colorado, development in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin includes Wells Ranch and Mustang areas. Chevrons integrated development plan provides an opportunity to efficiently produce these resources. In Wyoming, the company has acreage in the Powder River and Green River Basins. During 2020, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 175,000 barrels of crude oil, 96 million cubic feet of natural gas and 11,000 barrels of NGLs. Chevron is engaged in various operated and nonoperated exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron also holds nonoperated interests in several shelf fields. The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Additional development opportunities for the Jack and St. Malo fields progressed in 2020. Stage 3 development drilling continued with the final well completed in May 2020. The St. Malo Stage 4 waterflood project includes two new production wells, three injector wells, and topsides water injection equipment at the St. Malo field. First injection is expected in 2023. The Stage 4 multiphase subsea pump project replaces the single-phase subsea pumps in both the Jack and St. Malo fields. Progress during 2020 included beginning pump module installation. Proved reserves have been recognized for the multiphase subsea pump project. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated production life of 30 years. The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the deepwater Mad Dog Field. Project execution continued in 2020 on the Mad Dog 2 Project. This phase is the development of the southwestern extension of the Mad Dog Field, including a new floating production platform with a design capacity of 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Drilling and construction of the floating production unit are progressing as planned, and first oil is expected in 2022. Proved reserves have been recognized for the Mad Dog 2 Project. Chevron has a 60 percent-owned and operated interest in the Big Foot Project, located in the deepwater Walker Ridge area. Development drilling activities are ongoing, with the third production well coming online in September 2020. An additional well is expected to come online in third quarter 2021. The project has an estimated production life of 35 years. The company has a 58 percent-owned and operated interest in the deepwater Tahiti Field. Progress continued on the Tahiti Upper Sands Project, which includes topsides facility enhancements to process high gas rates with start-up anticipated in third quarter 2021.

As a result of the Noble acquisition, Chevron acquired a majority interest in Noble Midstream Partners LP (Noble Midstream). Noble Midstream is primarily focused in the DJ Basin in Colorado and Delaware Basin in Texas providing services to Chevron and third-party customers. In February 2021, Chevron announced a non-binding offer to acquire all of the outstanding common units of Noble Midstream Partners LP not already owned by Chevron or any of its affiliates. Refer to pages 12 through 13 in the Upstream section for information on the West African Gas Pipeline and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Shipping The companys marine fleet includes both U.S. and foreign flagged vessels. The operated fleet consists of conventional crude tankers, product carriers and LNG carriers. These vessels transport crude oil, LNG, refined products and feedstock in support of the companys global upstream and downstream businesses. Other Businesses Chevron Technical Center The companys technical center provides expertise to drive the application of technology, initiatives to transform Chevrons digital future, and innovative breakthrough technologies to support the future of energy.

Chevrons information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, cybersecurity and network technology to provide a digital infrastructure to enable Chevrons global operations and business processes. Chevrons Technology Ventures (CTV) unit identifies and integrates externally developed technologies and new business solutions with the potential to enhance the way Chevron produces and delivers affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy. CTV has more than two decades of venture investing, with eight funds that have supported more than 100 startups and worked with more than 200 co-investors. In addition to the companys own managed funds, Chevron also makes investments indirectly through the following funds: the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) Climate Investments fund targets the decarbonization of oil and gas, industry and commercial transportation; Emerald Ventures targets energy, water, industrial IT and advanced materials; and the HX Venture fund targets Houston, Texas high-growth start-ups. Chevron continued its participation as a member of OGCI, a global collaboration focused on the industrys efforts to take actions to accelerate and participate in a lower carbon future. In 2020, OGCI committed to a Global Gas Flaring Explorer web platform and set a target for OGCI members to reduce oil and gas carbon intensity. Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Refer to Note 25 on page 95 for a summary of the companys research and development expenses. Environmental Protection The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. To complement the companys capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project, which has the objective to further develop the industrys capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. The company is committed to improving energy efficiency in its day-to-day operations and is required to comply with the greenhouse gas-related laws and regulations to which it is subject. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 18 through 23 for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevrons business. Refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 49 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the companys 2020 environmental expenditures. Refer to page 49 and Note 22 beginning on page 92 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. "," Item 1A. Risk Factors Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the companys control and could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition. BUSINESS, OPERATIONAL AND ACQUISITION-RELATED RISK FACTORS Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a significant decrease in demand for Chevrons products and caused a precipitous drop in commodity prices that has had, and may continue to have, an adverse and potentially material adverse effect on Chevrons financial and operating results. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the economic, business, and oil and gas industry impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption to capital markets have continued to be far reaching. Crude oil prices, the single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations, fell to historic lows, even briefly going negative, due to a combination of a severely reduced demand for crude oil, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and other refined products resulting from government-mandated travel restrictions and the curtailment of economic activity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, a market imbalance has existed and may continue to exist, with oil supplies exceeding current and expected near-term demand. Although OPEC members and other countries have agreed to cut global oil supply, the commitments and actions to date have not matched the significant decrease in global demand, which has resulted in increased inventory levels in refineries, pipelines and storage facilities in prior periods and which may drive increased inventory levels in future periods. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil are expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the companys earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs may be negatively affected, as would its production volumes and proved reserves. As a result, the value of the companys assets may also become impaired in future periods, as we saw in 2020. The companys operations and workforce are being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, causing certain operations to be curtailed to various degrees. At 50 percent-owned Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan, COVID-19 infections have led to the demobilization of a significant portion of the workforce, adversely impacting the construction pace for completion of the FGP/WPMP project. Although infection levels in Kazakhstan improved in the third quarter 2020, allowing remobilization of the FGP/WPMP construction workforce to commence, a resurgence of infections prevented the final five percent of the planned workforce from returning to work in the fourth quarter 2020, slowing progress on the project. The ultimate effects of COVID-19 on FGP/WPMP construction remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. In particular, we are currently unable to predict whether COVID-19 will have a material adverse impact on our ability to complete FGP/WPMP on schedule or within the current cost estimate for the project. As a result of decreased demand for its products, the company made cuts to its upstream capital and exploratory expenditure program for 2020, which are expected to negatively impact future production, have led to and could lead to further negative revisions of reserves and could also lead to the further impairment of assets. Production curtailments, such as those due to the reductions imposed by OPEC+ nations in Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Angola, and other production curtailment actions taken by operators of assets for which the company has non-operated interests or due to market conditions, have exacerbated and may continue to further exacerbate these negative impacts in future periods. Within downstream, the company reduced its capital spending program and is also deferring certain discretionary maintenance activities while maintaining expenditures for asset integrity and reliability. The company has reduced the utilization rates of its refineries in response to reduced demand for its products, particularly greatly reduced demand for jet fuel due to the COVID-19 impact on travel and the aviation industry. The companys suppliers are also being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and access to materials, supplies, and contract labor has been strained. In certain cases, the company has received notices invoking force majeure provisions in supplier contracts. This strain on the financial health of the companys suppliers could put further pressure on the companys financial results and may negatively impact supply assurance and supplier performance. In-country conditions, including potential future waves of the COVID-19 virus in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates, could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity. In light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, management is currently unable to develop with any level of confidence estimates and assumptions that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period. In addition, the unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight. There continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial and operating results in future periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results, and for what duration and magnitude, depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve, are difficult to predict and, in many instances, are beyond the company's control. Such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any resurgences of the pandemic, and the impact on our workforce and operations; the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy and economic activity, including travel restrictions and prolonged low demand for our products; the ability of our affiliates, suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the actions of OPEC and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand and correspondingly, commodity prices; the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the pandemic subsides; and Chevrons ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, and the continuation or a resurgence of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could further materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and profitability, including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control (including without limitation due to the COVID-19 pandemic), competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the companys upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition depends. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, other forms of severe weather, wildfires, ambient temperature increases, sea level rise, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevrons risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. Cyberattacks targeting Chevrons process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevrons cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the companys information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the companys process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. Additionally, authorized third-party IT systems or software can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to Chevron's IT systems that can materially impact the companys business. Regardless of the precise method or form, cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. The Noble acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and the acquisition may disrupt our current plans or operations. The success of the Noble acquisition, which closed in October 2020, will depend, in part, on Chevrons ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including the anticipated annual run-rate operating and other cost synergies and accretion to return on capital employed, free cash flow and earnings per share. Failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected timeframe, operational challenges, the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns, and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition may have an adverse impact on our financial results. One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, Noble Midstream Partners LP, which may involve a potential legal liability. One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of Noble Midstream, a publicly traded master limited partnership. Our control of the general partner of Noble Midstream may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of duties owed to Noble Midstream, including claims of conflict of interest. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ESG-RELATED RISK FACTORS Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action. For example, liability or delays could result from an accidental, unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page 78. Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with U.S. sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company's operations in certain countries. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products, could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitability. Legislation, regulation, and other government actions related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change could continue to increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons hydrocarbon and other products Chevron may be challenged by a further increase in international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other government actions relating to GHG emissions and climate change. Like any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG and climate change-related legislation and regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the companys oil and gas resources economically infeasible. Although the International Energy Agencys (IEA) World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond, if new legislation, regulation, or other government action contributes to a decline in the demand for the companys products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition. International agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In some jurisdictions, the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and low carbon fuel standard obligations. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as, for example, via a carbon tax (e.g., Singapore and Canada) or via a cap-and-trade program (e.g., Mexico and China). Many governments are providing tax advantages and other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy sources or lower-carbon technologies. The landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-assessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws, regulations, and other actions, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate. GHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and government actions and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbon-based products; make the companys products more expensive; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the companys resources; and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues, and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among others, those associated with the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction, and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and related products; and consumers or customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products. Indirect regulation of GHG emissions could include bans or restrictions on technologies that use the companys hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products and substitute products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such legislation and regulations, are beyond the companys control. Consideration of climate change-related issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional, or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the companys long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate change-related policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the companys activities in it, and market conditions. The ultimate effect of international agreements; national, regional, and state legislation and regulation; and government actions related to GHG emissions and climate change on the companys financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government actions on the companys financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes. Increasing attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business Increasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer and customer use of substitutes to Chevrons products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against the company. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Also, some stakeholders, including but not limited to sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds, have been promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Unfavorable ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives may lead to negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. GENERAL RISK FACTORS Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

The company excluded Noble from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 because it was acquired by the company in a business combination during 2020. Total assets and total revenues of Noble, a wholly-owned subsidiary, represent eight percent and one percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein. (c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, there were no changes in the companys internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting.

2,cvx1,9-10kdoc," Item 1. Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page E-1 . As of December 31, 2019 , Chevron had approximately 48,200 employees (including about 3,500 service station employees). Approximately 25,400 employees (including about 3,200 service station employees), or 53 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. Operating Environment Refer to pages 28 through 34 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. Chevrons Strategic Direction Chevrons primary objective is to deliver industry-leading results and superior shareholder value in any business environment.

Delivery Commitments The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 951 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2020 through 2022 . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are primarily based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2,377 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2020 through 2022 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Indonesia and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas Chevron has exploration and production activities in many of the worlds major hydrocarbon basins. Chevrons 2019 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 32 , are presented below. The comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under Production in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-7 . The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. United States Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in the midcontinent region, the Gulf of Mexico, California and the Appalachian Basin. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2019 averaged 929,000 barrels. The companys activities in the midcontinent region are primarily in New Mexico and Texas. During 2019, net daily production in these areas averaged 259,000 barrels of crude oil, 835 million cubic feet of natural gas and 120,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). In the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, the company holds approximately 500,000 and 1,200,000 net acres of shale and tight resources in the Midland and Delaware basins, respectively. This acreage includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. The company is also applying data analytics and technology to drive improvements in identifying well targets, in drilling and completions and in production performance. In 2019, the companys net daily production in the basin averaged 244,000 barrels of crude oil, 735 million cubic feet of natural gas and 115,000 barrels of NGLs. The company also holds approximately 360,000 net acres in the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin. In July 2019, Chevron entered into a renewable wind power purchase agreement designed to cost-effectively power a portion of its Permian Basin operations. During 2019 , net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 200,000 barrels of crude oil, 112 million cubic feet of natural gas and 12,000 barrels of NGLs.

GSC reached a final investment decision in February 2019 to build an olefins mixed-feed cracker and polyethylene unit within the existing refining and aromatics facilities in Yeosu, South Korea. Transportation Pipelines Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and product pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and indirect interests in other U.S. and international pipelines. Refer to pages 11 through 13 in the Upstream section for information on the West African Gas Pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi- Ceyhan Pipeline, and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Shipping The companys marine fleet includes both U.S. and foreign flagged vessels. The operated fleet consists of conventional crude tankers, product carriers and LNG carriers. These vessels transport crude oil, LNG, refined products and feedstock in support of the companys global upstream and downstream businesses. Other Businesses Research and Technology Chevrons energy technology organization supports upstream and downstream businesses. The company conducts research, develops and qualifies technology, and provides technical services and competency development. The disciplines cover earth sciences, reservoir and production engineering, drilling and completions, facilities engineering, manufacturing, process technology, catalysis, technical computing and health, environment and safety. Chevrons information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, cybersecurity and network technology to provide a digital infrastructure to enable Chevrons global operations and business processes. In 2019, Chevron continued its involvement in the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), a global collaboration focused on the industrys efforts to take actions to accelerate and participate in the energy transition. OGCI members seek to lower carbon footprints of energy, industry, and transportation value chains. This includes work to reduce methane emissions, reduce the carbon intensity of upstream oil and gas emissions, and facilitate large-scale commercial investment in carbon capture, use and storage. OGCI Climate Investments is a $1 billion-plus investment fund set up by the OGCI member companies. OGCI Climate Investments focuses on three objectives: reducing methane emissions during the production, delivery and usage of oil and gas; reducing carbon dioxide emissions by increasing energy efficiency in power, industry and transport; and recycling and storing carbon dioxide produced during power generation or industrial processes by using it in products or storing it. As a member of OGCI, Chevron has committed to contribute $100 million to this fund. Chevrons technology ventures unit supports Chevrons upstream and downstream businesses by bridging the gap between business unit needs and emerging technology solutions developed externally in areas of emerging materials, water management, information technology, power systems and production enhancement. In 2018, Chevron established the Chevron Future Energy Fund with an initial commitment of $100 million to invest in breakthrough technologies that enable the ongoing energy transition. Our investments and partnerships have focused on areas such as alternative energy and emerging technologies, transportation and infrastructure, capturing and reducing emissions, and energy storage. Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Refer to Note 25 on page 89 for a summary of the companys research and development expenses. Environmental Protection The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. To complement the companys capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project, which has the objective to further develop the industrys capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. The company is committed to improving energy efficiency in its day-to-day operations and is required to comply with the greenhouse gas-related laws and regulations to which it is subject. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 18 through 21 for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevrons business. Refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 44 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the companys 2019 environmental expenditures. Refer to page 44 and Note 2 2 beginning on page 87 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. "," Item 1A. Risk Factors Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the companys control and could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the companys upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition depends. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the coronavirus, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevrons risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. Cyberattacks targeting Chevrons process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevrons cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the companys information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the companys process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. Additionally, authorized third-party IT systems can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to Chevron's IT systems during the normal course of business. The company has limited control and visibility over such third-party IT systems. Cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action. For example, liability or delays could result from an accidental, unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page 72 . The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with U.S. sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company's operations in certain countries. For example, with respect to our operations in Venezuela as discussed in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Other Contingencies and Commitments - Other Contingencies, future events could result in the environment in Venezuela becoming more challenged, which could lead to increased business disruption and volatility in the associated financial results. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitability. Regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has increased and could continue to increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons hydrocarbon and other products In the years ahead, companies in the energy industry, like Chevron, may be challenged by a further increase in international and domestic regulation relating to GHG emissions. Like any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the companys oil and gas resources economically infeasible. Although the IEAs World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation, if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the companys products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition. International agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In some jurisdictions, the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as, for example, via a carbon tax (e.g., Singapore and Canada) or via a cap-and-trade program (e.g., California, Mexico and China). The landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-assessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate. GHG emissions-related laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbon-based products, make the companys products more expensive, adversely affect the economic feasibility of the companys resources, and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among others, those associated with the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products and substitute products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the companys long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. Additionally, the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. The ultimate effect of international agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions on the companys financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on the companys financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes. Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business Increasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer and customer use of substitutes to Chevrons products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against the company. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

3,cvx1,8-10kdoc," Item 1. Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page E-1 . As of December 31, 2018 , Chevron had approximately 48,600 employees (including about 3,600 service station employees). Approximately 24,800 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees), or 51 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. Operating Environment Refer to pages 28 through 34 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world's major hydrocarbon basins. Chevrons 2018 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 32 , are presented below. The comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under Production in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-7 . The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. United States Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in the midcontinent region, the Gulf of Mexico, California and the Appalachian Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2018 averaged 791,000 barrels per day. The company's activities in the midcontinent region are primarily in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. During 2018, net daily production in these areas averaged 198,000 barrels of crude oil, 651 million cubic feet of natural gas and 77,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). In 2018, the company divested properties in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. The company is pursuing opportunities to increase development efficiency across the region. In the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, the company holds approximately 500,000 and 1,200,000 net acres of shale and tight resources in the Midland and Delaware basins, respectively. This acreage includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. The company is also applying data analytics and technology on its Permian well information to drive improvements in well targets and performance. In 2018, the company's net daily production in the basin averaged 159,000 barrels of crude oil, 501 million cubic feet of natural gas and 66,000 barrels of NGLs. During 2018 , net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 186,000 barrels of crude oil, 117 million cubic feet of natural gas and 13,000 barrels of NGLs. Chevron is engaged in various operated and nonoperated exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron also holds nonoperated interests in several shelf fields. The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields.

The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the companys upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition depends. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources  The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. Cyberattacks targeting Chevrons process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron's cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the companys information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the companys process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. The company has limited control and visibility over such third-party IT systems. Cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page 70 . The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with U.S. sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company's operations in certain countries. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability. Regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons hydrocarbon and other products  In the years ahead, companies in the energy industry, like Chevron, may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to GHG emissions. Like any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the companys oil and gas resources economically infeasible. Although the IEAs World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation, if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the companys products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition. International agreements and national, regional and state legislation (e.g., California AB32, SB32 and AB398) and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In some jurisdictions, the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as, for example, via a carbon tax (e.g., Singapore and Canada) or via a cap-and-trade program (e.g., Mexico and China). The landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-assessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate. GHG emissions-related laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbon-based products, make the companys products more expensive, adversely affect the economic feasibility of the companys resources, and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among others, those associated with the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. In addition, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against the company. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the companys long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. Additionally, the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. The ultimate effect of international agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions on the companys financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on the companys financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period  In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

Legal Proceedings Governmental Proceedings  The following is a description of legal proceedings that the company has determined to disclose for this reporting period that involve governmental authorities and certain monetary sanctions under federal, state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment. As previously disclosed, on August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron refinery in Richmond, California. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued alleged findings of violation related to the incident on December 17, 2013, pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act Risk Management Plan program (RMP). Following the Richmond incident, EPA also conducted RMP inspections at Chevrons refineries in El Segundo, California; Pascagoula, Mississippi; Kapolei, Hawaii; and Salt Lake City, Utah. On October 24, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) lodged with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California a consent decree executed by Chevron, DOJ, EPA, and the State of Mississippi that resolves all of EPAs alleged findings of violation related to the Richmond incident and subsequent RMP inspections. The consent decree includes the payment of a civil penalty of $2.95 million and the funding of supplemental environmental projects totaling $10 million. Chevron also agreed, as part of the consent decree, to investments in process safety enhancements at its current refineries, estimated at $150 million, a portion of which has already been spent. The consent decree is pending court approval. Chevron facilities within the jurisdiction of Californias Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) currently have multiple outstanding Notices of Violation (NOVs) issued by BAAQMD. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As previously disclosed, on June 26, 2018, Chevron received a proposal from the BAAQMD seeking to collectively resolve certain NOVs issued between 2015 and 2017 to Chevrons Richmond Refinery. On November 5, 2018, Chevron and the BAAQMD entered into a settlement agreement to resolve allegations in the disputed NOVs for a civil penalty of $222,000. Chevron facilities within the jurisdiction of Californias South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) currently have multiple outstanding NOVs issued by SCAQMD.

4,cvx1,7-10kdoc," Item 1. Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page E-2 . As of December 31, 2017 , Chevron had approximately 51,900 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees). Approximately 25,200 employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 49 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies, in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. Operating Environment Refer to pages 30 through 37 of this Form 10-K in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook. Chevrons Strategic Direction Chevrons primary objective is to deliver industry-leading results and superior shareholder value in any business environment. In the upstream, the companys strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities. In the downstream, the company's strategy is to grow earnings across the value chain and make targeted investments to lead the industry in returns. Information about the company is available on the companys website at www.chevron.com . Information contained on the companys website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the companys website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SECs website at www.sec.gov . ________________________________________________________ * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we, us and ""its"" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of Chevron  i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. Description of Business and Properties The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects * in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2017 , and assets as of the end of 2017 and 2016  for the United States and the companys international geographic areas  are in Note 1 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 67 . Similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Note 1 6 beginning on page 70 and Note 24 on page 87 . Refer to page 41 of this Form 10-K in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company's capital and exploratory expenditures. Upstream Reserves Refer to Table V beginning on page 95 for a tabulation of the companys proved net liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2015 and each year-end from 2015 through 2017 . Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 , are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations. At December 31, 2017 , 24 percent of the company's net proved oil-equivalent reserves were located in the United States, 21 percent were located in Australia and 20 percent were located in Kazakhstan. The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2015 through 2017 are shown in the following table:  At December 31       Liquids  Millions of barrels       Consolidated Companies 4,530  4,131  4,262  Affiliated Companies 2,012  2,197  2,000  Total Liquids 6,542  6,328  6,262  Natural Gas  Billions of cubic feet       Consolidated Companies 27,514  25,432  25,946  Affiliated Companies 3,222  3,328  3,491  Total Natural Gas 30,736  28,760  29,437  Oil-Equivalent  Millions of barrels *       Consolidated Companies 9,116  8,369  8,586  Affiliated Companies 2,549  2,752  2,582  Total Oil-Equivalent 11,665  11,121  11,168  * Oil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of crude oil . ________________________________________________________ *  As used in this report, the term project may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of the term project as it relates to any specific governmental law or regulation. Net Production of Liquids and Natural Gas  The following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2017 and 2016 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 2.728 million barrels per day in 2017 was up 5 percent from 2016 . Production increases from major capital projects, base business, and shale and tight properties, were partially offset by production entitlement effects in several locations, normal field declines, and the impact of asset sales. Refer to the Results of Operations section beginning on page 34 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2015 through 2017 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas, and refer to Table V on pages 98 and 99 for information on annual production by geographical region.

Delivery Commitments  The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 151 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2018 through 2020 . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are all based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2,380 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2018 through 2020 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark, Indonesia and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world's major hydrocarbon basins. Chevrons 2017 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 34 , are presented below. The comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under Production in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-8 . The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the companys share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. United States Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in the midcontinent region, the Gulf of Mexico, California and the Appalachian Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2017 averaged 681,000 barrels per day. The company's activities in the midcontinent region are primarily in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. During 2017, net daily production in these areas averaged 134,000 barrels of crude oil, 505 million cubic feet of natural gas and 50,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). In 2017, the company divested properties in areas including Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. The company is pursuing selected opportunities and actively transacting to create value. In the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, the company holds approximately 500,000 and 1,200,000 net acres of shale and tight resources in the Midland and Delaware basins, respectively. This acreage includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. The stacked plays multiply the basins resource and economic potential by allowing for multiple horizontal wells to be developed from a single pad location using shared facilities and infrastructure, which reduces development costs and improves capital efficiency. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. In 2017, the company deployed a new basis of design, resulting in improved economics. The company is also applying data analytics and petrophysical technology on its Permian well information to drive improvements in well targets and performance. The company drilled 130 wells and participated in 180 nonoperated wells in the Midland and Delaware basins in 2017. During 2017 , net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 165,000 barrels of crude oil, 122 million cubic feet of natural gas and 13,000 barrels of NGLs. In 2017, the company divested its remaining operated offshore assets in the shelf area. All remaining shelf assets are non-operated interests. Chevron is also engaged in various exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Total daily production from the Jack and St. Malo fields in 2017 averaged 116,000 barrels of liquids (59,000 net) and 18 million cubic feet of natural gas (9 million net). Production ramp-up and development drilling for the first development phase was completed in 2017. In addition, development drilling continued on Stage 2, the second phase of the development plan, with three of the four planned wells completed. Stage 3 includes three additional development wells. Stage 3 drilling began in second quarter 2017; execution is expected to continue in 2018. Proved reserves have been recognized for these phases. Production from the Jack/St. Malo development is expected to ramp up to a total daily rate of 142,000 barrels of crude oil and 36 million cubic feet of natural gas. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated remaining production life of 30 years. At the 58 percent-owned and operated deepwater Tahiti Field, net daily production averaged 45,000 barrels of crude oil, 18 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 3,000 barrels of NGLs. Infill drilling continued in 2017. The Tahiti Vertical Expansion Project is the next development phase of the Tahiti Field, developing shallower reservoirs and encompassing four new wells and associated subsea infrastructure. All wells have been drilled, and facility installation work has commenced. First oil is expected in second-half 2018. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The Tahiti Field has an estimated production life of at least 20 years. The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the deepwater Mad Dog Field. In 2017, net daily production averaged 8,000 barrels of liquids and 1 million cubic feet of natural gas. The next development phase, the Mad Dog 2 Project, is planned to develop the southwestern extension of the Mad Dog Field. The development plan includes a new floating production platform with a design capacity of 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day. A final investment decision was reached in February 2017. First oil is expected in 2021.  At the end of 2017, proved reserves have been recognized for the Mad Dog 2 Project. The development plan for the 60 percent-owned and operated deepwater Big Foot Project includes a 15-slot drilling and production tension leg platform (TLP) with water injection facilities and a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. The TLP has been moored in its final location; installation is expected to be completed in second quarter 2018. First oil is expected in late 2018. The field has an estimated production life of 35 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. Chevron holds a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in the Stampede Project, the unitized development of the deepwater Knotty Head and Pony discoveries. The planned facilities have a design capacity of 80,000 barrels of crude oil and 40 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Installation of the TLP and subsea infrastructure was completed in 2017, with first oil achieved in January 2018. The field has an estimated production life of 30 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. During 2017 and early 2018, the company participated in two appraisal wells and four exploration wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron has operated working interests of 55 to 61.3 percent in the blocks containing the Anchor Field. The appraisal drilling program for the Anchor Field concluded in 2017 with the successful Anchor appraisal well. The company filed for Suspension of Production (SOP) in January 2018. The SOP is intended to hold the associated leases as the planned development matures. Activities are underway to mature a cost effective development plan. Chevron is the operator of an exploration and appraisal program and potential development named Tigris, covering several jointly held offshore leases in the northwest portion of Keathley Canyon. This area may have the potential to support a cost-effective, deepwater hub development of multiple fields to a new central host. Activities are underway to mature the development plan. Exploration and appraisal activities have been completed at the 50 percent-owned Tiber and Guadalupe fields. The company has obtained an SOP for the Tiber Unit, and recently filed for an SOP on the Guadalupe Unit. Adjacent leases containing the Gibson prospect are expected to be part of the development. During 2017 and early 2018, the company participated in successful discovery and appraisal wells at the nonoperated Whale prospect in the Perdido area, which resulted in a significant crude oil discovery. Chevron has a 40 percent working interest in the Whale prospect. Chevron announced a significant crude oil discovery in the 60 percent-owned and operated Ballymore prospect in January 2018. Ballymore is located in the Mississippi Canyon area, approximately 3 miles from Chevron's Blind Faith Platform. A sidetrack well is currently being drilled to further assess the discovery. Chevron added 35 leases to its deepwater portfolio as a result of awards from the central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 247, held in March 2017, and Lease Sale 249, held in August 2017. Chevron also added 10 additional leases through asset swaps. In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2017 , net daily production averaged 148,000 barrels of crude oil, 53 million cubic feet of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of NGLs.

In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project, which has the objective to further develop the industrys capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. The company is committed to improving energy efficiency in its day-to-day operations and is required to comply with the greenhouse gas-related laws and regulations to which it is subject. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 19 through 22 for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevrons business. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 45 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2017 environmental expenditures. Refer to page 45 and Note 2 5 on page 88 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. "," Item 1A. Risk Factors Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the company's control and could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices  Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the companys upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to debt markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition depends. The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources  The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. Cyberattacks targeting Chevrons process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the companys information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and third parties with which the company conducts business. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the companys process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. The company has limited control and visibility over such third-party IT systems. Cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations. The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 1 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page 71 . The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business The companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with U.S. sanctions laws and regulations which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company's operations in certain countries. In addition, changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability. Regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons hydrocarbon and other products  In the years ahead, companies in the energy industry, like Chevron, may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to GHG emissions. Like any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the companys oil and gas resources economically infeasible. Although the IEAs World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation, if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the companys products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition. International agreements and national, regional and state legislation (e.g., California AB32, SB32 and AB398) and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries are studying and adopting policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In some jurisdictions, the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as, for example, via a carbon tax (e.g., Singapore and Canada) or via a cap-and-trade program (e.g., Mexico and China). The landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-assessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate. GHG emissions-related laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbon-based products, make the companys products more expensive, adversely affect the economic feasibility of the companys resources, and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among others, those associated with the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. In addition, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against the company. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the companys long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. Additionally, the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. The ultimate effect of international agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions on the companys financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on the companys financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period  In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

Legal Proceedings Governmental Proceedings  Chevron facilities within the jurisdiction of Californias South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) currently have multiple outstanding Notices of Violation (NOVs) issued by SCAQMD. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. In addition, as initially disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, in April 2016, Chevron received a proposal from the SCAQMD seeking to collectively resolve certain NOVs issued in 2012 and 2013 to Chevrons El Segundo Refinery. Subsequently, the SCAQMD provided notice to Chevron that it was also seeking to resolve certain NOVs issued to the refinery in 2014. In December 2017, Chevron and the SCAQMD entered into a settlement agreement to resolve allegations in six NOVs for a civil penalty of $375,500. In January 2018, Chevron and the SCAQMD entered into a settlement agreement to resolve allegations associated with the remaining three NOVs for a civil penalty of $5,137,250. As initially disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, on August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron refinery in Richmond, California. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued alleged findings of violation related to the incident on December 17, 2013, pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act Risk Management Plan program (RMP). Following the Richmond incident, EPA also conducted RMP inspections at Chevrons El Segundo, California; Pascagoula, Mississippi; Kapolei, Hawaii; and Salt Lake City, Utah refineries. With the participation of the United States Department of Justice, Chevron and EPA are negotiating a potential combined resolution that may include all of EPAs alleged findings of violation related to the Richmond incident and subsequent RMP inspections. Resolution of those alleged findings of violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As initially disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, on December 5, 2016, Chevron received a NOV from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) alleging that for compliance years 2011-2015, Chevron failed to deduct some exported volumes of fuel from the sales that must be reported under the states Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program. The allegation is that Chevron purchased and retired more LCFS credits than were required. Chevron and CARB are negotiating a potential resolution of the alleged violation. Resolution of this NOV may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As initially disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017,  on November 18, 2016, Chevron received an Administrative Order (AO) from the EPA alleging noncompliance with the water permit that governed conveyances of captured groundwater and spring water from the former Questa mine located in New Mexico to its associated tailing facility. Chevron is concluding its negotiations with EPA regarding this matter. As initially disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, on August 3, 2017, Chevron received a Notice of Intent to File an Administrative Complaint from the EPA in connection with certain waste matters at the Kapolei, Hawaii refinery during the period of time that the facility was owned and operated by Chevron.
